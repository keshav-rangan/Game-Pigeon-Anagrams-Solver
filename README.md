# Game-Pigeon-Anagrams-Solver
Solver for the Game Pigeon Anagrams game in Python

If 6 letters are provided, all the 6 letter (2000 points) and 5 letter (1200 points) words will be given. However, the goal is for the user to see the words they missed, not to win by cheating. Keep this in mind... I'm watching. (for legal purposes, the previous statement is untruthful)

There is a current issue (for lack of a better word) where words with multiple letters are printed twice due to how the program works. This can be removed easily, but the method I have in mind for doing so is inefficient and so I don't want to do it. If you have a suggestion with good runtime, please feel free to submit.
